            <h2>Pied Piper Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Pied Piper is a multi-platform technology based on a proprietary universal compression algorithm that
                has
                consistently scored high Weisman Scores that are not merely competitive, but approach the theoretical
                limit
                of lossless compression.

            <h4>Founders</h4>
            <h4>
                Richard Hendricks
            </h4>
            <p>
                Richard Hendricks was the CEO and founder of Pied Piper as well as PiperNet, and is currently a Gavin
                Belson
                Professor of Ethics in Technology at Stanford. Before founding Pied Piper, Richard was an employee of
                Hooli.
                At work he was often an antagonist to the brogrammers. While at Hooli, Richard worked on the Pied Piper
                algorithm. However, even though Richard created one line of code on the algorithm on a Hooli laptop
                which
                would mean that Pied Piper would be property of Hooli, Richard's contract with Hooli was void due to a
                clause preventing him from leaving. Richard continued to work on Pied Piper until its demise, but still
                was
                involved with Pied Piper projects such as PiperChat and PiperNet until the company would be shut down in
                2019.

            <h4>
                Erlich Bachman
            </h4>
            <p>
                Erlich Bachman, portrayed by T.J. Miller, is an arrogant entrepreneur who founded an innovation
                incubator in his home after the purchase of his airfare collator Aviato. Erlich still holds on to his
                glory days in the valley, wearing Aviato T-shirts and driving a Ford Escape adorned with Aviato logos.
                Under the incubator agreement, Erlich owns 10% of Pied Piper, and is later appointed to the company's
                board of directors after Richard Hendricks realizes how important Erlich is to the business. Erlich is a
                frequent user of marijuana. It is revealed in the season 2 finale that Erlich no longer codes because of
                severe carpal tunnel syndrome. Despite being relatively unsuccessful in his own entrepreneurial
                ventures, he is a charismatic public speaker and negotiator, and is often seen as the "face" of Pied
                Piper. In season 3 he begins to have a less active role in Pied Piper. He begins to start his own VC
                firm with Nelson Bighetti but then declares bankruptcy. After selling his Pied Piper shares to cover his
                debts, he gets rehired into the company as a PR representative. When Richard starts his new company
                using the Pied Piper trademark, Erlich then owns 10% of the new company while keeping his PR job at the
                old company which is eventually deleted. Erlich then decides to focus on Jian-Yang's product which also
                fails. After another failed deal with Keenan Feldspar and quitting his job at Bream-Hall, Erlich then
                decides that he and Richard will never be successful and moves away to Tibet to join Gavin Belson at a
                monastery at the end of season 4. After Gavin was informed that Jack Barker was being held hostage, he
                immediately proceeds to take Erlich with him to leave Tibet. However, Erlich then becomes incubated upon
                consuming opium at an Inn, and Gavin pays the innkeeper enough money to take care of Erlich for five
                years. Erlich is never heard from again afterward, although Richard reveals in "Exit Event" that he
                tried to look for Erlich in Tibet.

            <h4>
                Bertram Gilfoyle
            </h4>
            <p>
                Bertram Gilfoyle, portrayed by Martin Starr, is a LaVeyan Satanist network engineer and system
                architect. Initially an undocumented immigrant from Canada, Gilfoyle successfully applied for a visa
                after being pressured by Dinesh Chugtai. Gilfoyle credits himself as an online security expert, and as
                such is responsible for system administration and server configuration at Pied Piper. Gilfoyle has a
                girlfriend Tara (Milana Vayntrub) who is also a LaVeyan Satanist, with the two having an open and
                long-standing relationship, though Tara still lies to Gilfoyle about sleeping with other men. Gilfoyle
                often plays mocking pranks on Dinesh, but the two do appear to be friends or at most, frenemies despite
                this, with the two often bonding over their shared moral ambiguity. While he is usually indifferent to
                Richard and lacks loyalty toward him, Gilfoyle highly respects Richard as a coder and admits that Pied
                Piper is nothing without Richard. Like Dinesh, Gilfoyle is quick-witted and merciless, but in contrast,
                highly apathetic, sardonic and brutally honest. He acts as the systems architect of Pied Piper. Gilfoyle
                is very confident in his abilities and has proven his worth to the Pied Piper team on multiple
                occasions, such as building the server farm "Anton", to save the company the struggle of paying for
                generic, mediocre servers in an office space. Due to this, Gilfoyle takes great pride in his security
                tech, becoming very nervous and confused whenever his tech is compromised. In season 5, Gilfoyle is
                promoted to senior management along with Dinesh with the title of "Chief Systems Architect". By Season
                6, Gilfoyle is promoted to VP of Architecture at Pied Piper but refuses to take anyone under his
                management, preferring to work on the Systems Architecture by himself. This leads to continual conflict
                with Head of HR Tracy Robertson. After Pied Piper was shut down, Gilfoyle and Dinesh began to run a
                large cybersecurity firm together.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Dinesh Chugtai
            </h4>
            <p>
                Dinesh lives and works in the Hacker Hostel with Richard, Big Head, and Gilfoyle. He possesses a dry wit
                and skills at writing code, particularly Java. Dinesh often finds himself sparring with Gilfoyle.
                He is originally from Pakistan but is a US citizen, unlike Gilfoyle. He claims it took him five years to
                get US citizenship and was asked about Al-Qaeda "like 14 times."

            <h4>
                Donald "Jared" Dunn
            </h4>
            <p>
                Donald "Jared" Dunn was a Hooli executive and right-hand man to the head of the company, Gavin Belson,
                but after gaining a particular interest in Richardâ€™s algorithm, quit his job at Hooli to work for Pied
                Piper.

                Jared was raised by a series of foster parents, but despite this rocky early life went on to study at
                Vassar College, earning a B. A. in Economics.

                Although his real first name is Donald, Gavin Belson started calling him 'Jared' on his first day at
                Hooli, and the name stuck.
